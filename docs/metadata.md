# Urban Forest Dataset – Metadata

This document describes the structure of the datasets provided in CSV format.  
Each row corresponds to a polygon of the district generated by the segmentation.

## 📂 Dataset Columns

- **NAME_DIST** – Name of the district  

- **ACRONYM_DIST** – District acronym  

- **COD_DIST** – The city of São Paulo is divided into several administrative districts, which are geographic units that facilitate public management and the distribution of services. Each district has a unique code (for example, "01" for the Água Rasa district), which serves to quickly identify the administrative region within the city.  

- **COD_SUB** – In addition to districts, the city is subdivided into smaller areas called subdistricts. Each subdistrict is part of a larger district and also has a unique code. Subdistricts provide a more detailed territorial division for organizing local services and statistics. For Água Rasa, the subdistrict would be identified by the code "25".  

- **AREA_DIST_m2** – Total area of the district in square meters (m²).  

- **PERIMETER_DIST_km** – Perimeter of the district in kilometers (km).  

- **AREA_DIST_VEG_m2** – Vegetation area in square meters (m²) within the total district area.  

- **AREA_DIST_CITY_m2** – Area of urban structures in square meters (m²) within the total district area.  

- **AREA_DIST_SHADOWS_m2** – Area of shadows in square meters (m²) within the total district area.  

- **DN** – Polygon ID. In QGIS, the field DN (or "DN") can be used to represent the "Digital Value" or "Digital Number" in certain attribute tables.  

- **PREDICTED** – Class predicted by the classification.  

- **AREA_POLYGON_m2** – Area of the specific segmented polygon in square meters (m²).  

- **LAT** – Latitude of the polygon centroid.  

- **LONG** – Longitude of the polygon centroid.
